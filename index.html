        My ultimate goal is to become a coding wizard.
        Coding wizards are full-stack developers who know the ins and outs of all facets of web development.
        Once I have mastered the magic of the web I will use my power to work for an organization that shapes the fabric of our society through pop culture content.
        I crave to deliver powerful narrative experiences through UX design which inspire people to make their (real and fictional) worlds better.

      <p>
        I am a 2017 college graduate who realized her degree in American Popular Culture (while fascinating) would not amount to a creative job in technology without some help.
        Enter CoderGirl from the trailblazing Saint Louis based organization LaunchCode.
        The CoderGirl program is helping me self-actualize who I want to be as a professional by refining my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge base.
