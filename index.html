        G. A. B. - "Gab"
      </br>
        My ultimate goal is to become a coding wizard.
        Coding wizards are full-stack developers who know the ins and outs of all facets of web development.
        Once I have mastered the magic of the web I will use my power to work for an organization that shapes the fabric of our society through pop culture content.
        I crave to deliver powerful narrative experiences through UX design which inspire people to make their (real and fictional) worlds better.

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <div class='experience'>
      <h3>CoderGirl</h3>
      <p>
        I am a 2017 college graduate who realized her degree in American Popular Culture (while fascinating) would not amount to a creative job in technology without some help.
        Enter CoderGirl from the trailblazing Saint Louis based organization LaunchCode.
        The CoderGirl program is helping me self-actualize who I want to be as a professional by refining my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge base.
      </p>
      <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
      <p>
        Bear with me here - all interactive user design concepts lead to D and D. Just as all modern RPG video games one way or another, lead here.
        D and D is the foundation that launched our entire modern era of gaming and consequently user experience design.
        The entire premise of this nerd culture cornerstone is testing - then exceeding - the limits of what is possible when multiple people interact with the same concept.
        I am a newly minted Dungeon Master (meaning I run and design the entire UX for my players) and can attest to there being few things more intellectually challenging than designing a fun interactive experience for multiple players with diverse (sometimes opposing) goals for the game.

      The list of skills and best practices below is by no means exhaustive and is constantly evolving.
      JavaScript and Sass are in the works to be added soon.
    </br>
      Languages I will add to my repotoire over the next few years include: Python, C#, Ruby.
